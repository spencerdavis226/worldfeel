## Why These Were Removed

These styles were identified as unused through:
1. Static analysis of the codebase
2. Searching for class usage across all components
3. Tailwind CSS purge analysis

## Potential Future Use

Some of these styles might be useful for:
- Future UI components
- Design system expansion
- Alternative layouts or themes
- A/B testing different visual approaches

## Restoration

To restore any of these styles, simply move them back to the appropriate location in the main codebase and ensure they are actually used in components.
