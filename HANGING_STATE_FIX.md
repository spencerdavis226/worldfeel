# Hanging State Issue Fix

## Problem Description

The Results page and input field were experiencing hanging states where nothing would load until the app was quit and reloaded. This was particularly problematic with Render.com's cold start behavior.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **No Request Timeouts**: Fetch requests had no timeout handling, causing indefinite hanging when servers were spinning up or unresponsive.

2. **Render.com Cold Start Behavior**: Render.com puts servers to sleep after inactivity. When they wake up, there's a delay before they're ready to serve requests, during which requests can hang indefinitely.

3. **No AbortController**: Fetch requests didn't use AbortController, so there was no way to cancel hanging requests.

4. **Aggressive Auto-refresh**: The `useStats` hook refreshed every 15 seconds, compounding the hanging issue.

5. **No Visual Feedback**: Users had no indication when the app was using fallback data due to connectivity issues.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Request Timeout Handling

**Files Modified:**

- `apps/web/src/lib/apiClient.ts`
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useStats.ts`
- `apps/web/src/features/ResultsPage.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/features/HomePage.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added `AbortController` with timeout handling to all fetch requests
- Default timeout: 10 seconds for general requests
- Stats requests: 6-8 seconds for faster fallback
- Emotion search: 1 second for quick suggestions
- Submit requests: 8 seconds for user submissions

### 2. Improved Error Handling

**Files Modified:**

- `apps/web/src/lib/apiClient.ts`
- `apps/web/src/features/HomePage.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Better timeout error detection and handling
- Clear suggestions on search errors to prevent hanging dropdowns
- More detailed error logging for debugging

### 3. Reduced Refresh Frequency

**Files Modified:**

- `apps/web/src/hooks/useStats.ts`
- `apps/web/src/features/ResultsPage.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Increased refresh interval from 15s to 30s to reduce server load
- Added request cancellation to prevent overlapping requests

### 4. Visual Feedback for Offline Mode

**Files Modified:**

- `apps/web/src/components/ServerStatusIndicator.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added subtle "Offline mode" indicator when using fallback data
- Shows yellow pulsing dot in top-right corner when server is unavailable

### 5. Loading Timeout Protection

**Files Modified:**

- `apps/web/src/features/ResultsPage.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added 8-second loading timeout with user-friendly message
- "Try Again" button to reload the page if loading takes too long
- Prevents indefinite hanging on the results page

## How This Addresses Render.com Behavior

1. **Fast Fallback**: With 6-8 second timeouts, users get fallback data quickly instead of waiting indefinitely for a spinning server.

2. **Visual Feedback**: Users know when they're in offline mode and can understand why data might be different.

3. **Graceful Degradation**: The app continues to work with mock data while the server spins up.

4. **Recovery**: Once the server is back online, pending submissions are automatically sent.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Cold Start**: Deploy to Render.com and test after server has been idle
2. **Test Network Issues**: Use browser dev tools to simulate slow/unreliable connections
3. **Test Timeout Behavior**: Verify fallback data appears within expected timeframes
4. **Test Recovery**: Ensure pending submissions are sent when server comes back online

## Configuration

The timeouts can be adjusted in the following locations:

- **General API timeout**: `DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` in `apiClient.ts` (10s)
- **Stats timeout**: `requestTimeout` option in `useStats` hook (6s)
- **Search timeout**: `timeout` parameter in `searchEmotions` calls (3s)
- **Submit timeout**: `timeout` parameter in `submitWord` calls (8s)
- **Loading timeout**: `setTimeout` in `ResultsPage` (8s)

## Future Improvements

1. **Progressive Web App**: Add service worker for better offline experience
2. **Connection Quality Detection**: Adjust timeouts based on network conditions
3. **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
4. **Server Health Monitoring**: More sophisticated server status tracking
